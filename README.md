# Valentine Message

Send a valentine message to a loved one.

Based on an experiment with svg animations and [velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org/) by [Teodora](https://github.com/teodora-n/Valentine).

## Customize your message
While you might love cheese as much as I do, you probably don't want your message to be about it. To set your own, [remix this app](https://gomix.com/#!/remix/valentine-message/fd4fea9d-291a-41e7-85ef-cd8304bd06fd) and edit the value for the `VALENTINE_MESSAGE` variable in `server.js`. Then share your app with your lover(s).
